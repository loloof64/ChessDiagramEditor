# Chess Diagram Editor

Easily create your chess diagrams as JPEG images.


## Developers   

This project has been made with QtCreator and Qt 5.9.7(Linux) / Qt 5.14.2 (Windows).
I had to keep an old version for Linux as the Qt PPA for Ubuntu trusty was only available up to Qt 5.9.7.

Don't forget to generate translations files, from resources/translations subfolder, with Qt Linguist.
